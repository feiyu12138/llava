Context: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.
The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

Cooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.
Figure: studying an architect's design.
Which of the following could Cooper's test show?
A. if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design
B. which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area
C. which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road
Answer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.B
