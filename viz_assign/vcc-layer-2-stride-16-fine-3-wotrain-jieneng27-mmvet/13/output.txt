I am getting one funghi pizza and one prosciutto pizza. How much should I pay in total?To determine the total cost of your order, you need to add the prices of the two pizzas. The funghi pizza costs 7.50 euros, and the prosciutto pizza costs 11.50 euros. Therefore, the total cost of your order is 7.50 + 11.50 = 19 euros.
