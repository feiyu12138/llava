Find the pattern of how the "X" operator is redefined, and answer the given equation in the image.In the image, the "X" operator is redefined as the result of multiplying the number by 100. To solve the equation, we need to find the value of the missing number.

Let's start by solving the equation for the missing number:

100 \* [missing number] = 100 \* [the number in the equation]

Now, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the missing number:

missing number = [the number in the equation] / 100

To find the value of the missing number, we can use a calculator or a computer to convert the given number to a decimal and then divide it by 100. The result will be the missing number.
