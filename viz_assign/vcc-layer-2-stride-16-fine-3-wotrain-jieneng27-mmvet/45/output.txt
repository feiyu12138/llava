What is the difference in metric tonnes between the amount of plastic produced and the amount discarded?The difference in metric tonnes between the amount of plastic produced and the amount discarded is significant. In 2016, humans produced approximately 381 million metric tonnes of plastic, while only 10% of that amount, or 38.1 million metric tonnes, was discarded. This means that the majority of the plastic produced is not being disposed of properly, and it is contributing to environmental issues such as pollution and harm to wildlife. The image highlights the need for better waste management practices and increased awareness about the importance of recycling and reducing plastic waste.
