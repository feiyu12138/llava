What should I do after kneading the dough, before dividing it into pieces?After kneading the dough, you should let it rest for a few minutes before dividing it into pieces. This allows the gluten to relax and the dough to become more elastic, which is essential for achieving a good texture in the final product. Resting the dough also helps to develop the gluten, resulting in a more tender and well-textured bread.
