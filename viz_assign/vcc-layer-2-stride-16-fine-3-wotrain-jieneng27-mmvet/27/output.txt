What earth's interior structure does number 2 indicate?Number 2 in the image indicates the mantle, which is the layer of the Earth's interior that lies between the crust and the core. The mantle is primarily composed of rock and is responsible for the Earth's tectonic activity, including plate tectonics and the formation of mountains. It is also the layer that transfers heat from the Earth's interior to the surface, contributing to the Earth's climate.
