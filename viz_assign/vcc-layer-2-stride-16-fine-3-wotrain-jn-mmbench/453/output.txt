Volcanic eruptions are classified by their appearance and their behavior. During a Hawaiian eruption, for example, lava is ejected from the volcano in a column. These jets can last for several hours or for days. The lava that flows from this type of eruption can often travel for miles before cooling and hardening.
A Strombolian eruption, on the other hand, occurs when lava erupts from the volcano in short-lived bursts that result in scattered sprays of lava. These bursts often resemble bright, exploding fireworks.
