The sea is home to many different groups, or phyla, of animals. Two of these are cnidarians and echinoderms.
Cnidarian comes from a Greek word that means "nettle," a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians have tentacles all around their mouths, which they use to sting prey and pull the prey toward their mouths.
Echinoderm comes from Greek words meaning "spiny" and "skin." Echinoderms have stiff bodies, and their spines may stick out of their skins. Adult echinoderms' bodies are often arranged in five balanced parts, like a star.
