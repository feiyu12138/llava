The stem of a plant contains different types of tissue. Two of these types are xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue carries water and nutrients from the roots of the plant to the leaves. Xylem moves materials in only one direction, up the plant's stem. Phloem tissue carries nutrients from the leaves to other parts of the plant. The nutrients in phloem tissue can move in two directions, either up or down the plant's stem.
