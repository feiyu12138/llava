If something has bilateral symmetry, you can draw a line from top to bottom and both sides of the line will match. For example, if you drew a line down the center of someone's face, both sides would have one eye, half a nose, and half a mouth. If you drew a line in the middle from left to right, however, the two sides would not match.
Radial symmetry describes something that is symmetrical, or matching, all the way around. A daisy, and many other flowers, have radial symmetry. You could cut a daisy in half from top to bottom in many directions‚Äîdown the middle or left to right‚Äîand the halves would match.
