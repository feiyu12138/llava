"Cleavage" and "fracture" refer to the different ways that minerals can break. Cleavage occurs when a mineral breaks and forms flat planes or surfaces. These surfaces are smooth and often reflective. Minerals break cleanly along cleavage planes because there are weak points in the mineral's structure.
When a mineral breaks by fracturing, it does not break along a smooth cleavage plane. Instead, this type of break results in surfaces that may look jagged or irregular.
