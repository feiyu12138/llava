There are two kinds of energy: kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object. Wind and flowing water both have kinetic energy. Another type of energy is potential energy. There are different types of potential energy. You can think of potential energy as kinds of stored energy. For example, a compressed spring has elastic potential energy. If it doesn't have something holding it down, its energy will be released and it will spring forward.
Which term matches the picture?
A. kinetic energy
B. potential energyB
