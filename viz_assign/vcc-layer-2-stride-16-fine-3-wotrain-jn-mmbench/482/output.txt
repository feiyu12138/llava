The Ophiuroidea are marine animals that are closely related to true sea stars, or the Asteroidea. Ophiuroids are divided into two groups: brittle stars and basket stars.
Brittle stars generally have five arms joined to a central body disk. Unlike those of true sea stars, the central body disks of brittle stars are usually round and sharply contrast with the arms.
Basket stars are similar to brittle stars, but often larger. Unlike the thin snake-like arms of brittle stars, the arms of basket stars are often repeatedly branched.
